		<h3>Sabine - September 2005</h3>
		<p>
			<font color="#f3b600"><span style="color: #00ff00">09/10/05</span></font> - The
			second week of September we all took a vacation down in Los Angeles. Daddy had a
			conference to attend so we went down a few days early and had some fun at Disneyland.</p>
		<p>
			The airplane ride down was Sabine's first and she did really well. Only the last
			30 minutes or so was she antsy and wanting off the plane. She also didn't like the
			descent because of the ear popping we suspect. It was only a 2hour flight and was
			a bit of an experiment to see how she would do. We got in just a little late and
			headed off to the Wilshire Grand hotel in downtown LA.</p>
		<p>
			The first night was pretty horrible. Sabine had been showing signs of a cold the
			day before and we suspect she had a sore throat that night. She was up every hour
			or so screaming her lungs out. I think Nancy and I each got 2 or 3 hours of sleep.
			But the next day (Sunday) we were off to Disneyland. The drive down to Anaheim was
			only 30 minutes from our hotel and we didn't hit any traffic. We all had a great
			time, the weather was perfect and we ate lots of food.</p>
		<p>
			Sabine really loved the parade, as she got to see many of the Disney characters
			that she was just starting to become accustomed to.</p>
		<p>
			<font color="#f3b600"><span style="color: #00ff00">09/12/05</span></font> - After
			a leisurely morning in the hotel, enjoying the free breakfast we headed down to
			Disneyland again on Monday. We hadn't planned on a second day but we all had so
			much fun on Sunday we couldn't resist, and there was lots of the park we hadn't
			seen yet.</p>
		<p>
			We started with a train ride around the whole park, Sabine likes trains. This day
			we decided to make an effort to get pictures of Sabine with lots of the Disney characters.
			We ended up with six. Mickey was by far her favorite. It is really cute to see how
			worked up she can get about seeing him for real.</p>
		<p>
			She had a harder time with her nap on the second day and ended up in a pretty serious
			tantrum. It was no fun for anyone but mommy did manage to get her to sleep in her
			lap for over an hour and she was in a pretty good mood afterward.</p>
		<p>
			We stayed until closing the second night, after watching the evening parade. They
			close fairly early during the week in September (8pm) but we all really loved the
			atmosphere after dark, the lights were really amazing. And it is the "Happiest Place
			on Earth" after all. What a fun place. We'll most certainly be going back some day
			when Sabine is a bit older.</p>
		<p>
			<font color="#f3b600"><span style="color: #00ff00">09/16/05</span></font> - The
			day that we flew back home (Friday) we spent a few hours in Santa Monica after checking
			out of the hotel. It is just down I10 from downtown LA and right on the coast. What
			huge beaches they have down there, amazing. It was another beautiful day. We had
			a nice lunch and strolled along the promenade then headed down to LAX. We hit some
			serious traffic and were a bit worried we might be late, but we ended up with plenty
			of time as Santa Monica is really quite close to LAX, though it was hard to tell
			from the map.</p>
		<p>
			The plane left over 30 minutes late but Sabine was once again really good on the
			plane. We had enough time for her to run around the airport before we left that
			she was able to burn off some excess energy. When we landed the people behind us
			were surprised to learn that there was a 2yr old in front of them. They were impressed
			that she didn't make a peep during the flight.</p>
		<p>
			All in all it was quite a family adventure. A very different vacation than Nancy
			and I have ever taken. Lots more work than we are used to on a vacation, but it
			was worth it.</p>
		<p>
			We didn't get home until around 9:30pm but Sabine had been going to sleep late all
			week in the hotel room. It took us 3 or 4 days to get her back on her normal sleep
			schedule.</p>
