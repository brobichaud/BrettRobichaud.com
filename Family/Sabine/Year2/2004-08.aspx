		<h3>Sabine - August 2004</h3>
		<p>
			Phew, it has been a while. Things have been crazy busy around here. We've sold our
			house in Beavercreek and bought one in Hillsboro. Who ever said buying and selling
			was easy? It was a huge undertaking for us but Sabine was amazing throughout. She
			is really starting to turn into an independent little girl, and she is so darned
			cute to boot.</p>
		<p>
			We were incredibly lucky to get a very reasonable offer on our house just 4 days
			after we listed it. We accepted. If only the rest of our dealings with the buyers
			went to smoothly. They didn't, long story and I wont bore you with the details.</p>
		<p>
			It took us a bit longer to find a place to buy. We have somewhat stringent requirements.
			Land with a nice house in the Portland area is not easy to come by, well not unless
			you're independently wealthy that is. But we found a really nice place on Bald Peak
			in Hillsboro. It's at 1150' elevation and has a rather nice view of Beaverton, Hillsboro
			&amp; Tigard. We are 15 minutes from Newberg, a nice small town with all the basic
			services we need. And only 30mins to Beaverton where Digimarc is moving in October.
			The commute from the old house was looking to be about 60mins.</p>
		<p>
			The move went well overall. It was a huge amount of work for all of us but we got
			through it. Now we are trying to settle in and make a new home for ourselves. It's
			hard. Don't let anyone fool you. It will take us a while, little Sabine will see
			to that.</p>
		<p>
			We lost our poor little White Kitty. She came with us to the new house. After the
			first night in the garage we decided to let them explore a little. We think a neighbor
			cat scared her away the next night, as Black Kitty and Spike were not to be seen
			for another day, but they did come back. Black Kitty proceeded to ease into the
			new surroundings with her usual flair, as did spike. But we have not seen White
			Kitty since. Nancy put up signs and tried a live trap, no luck. We just hope she
			is off somewhere living with a nice family in the surrounding area.</p>
		<p>
			In the move we also lost access to broadband. So yes we have taken a huge step backward
			technologically and are using a lowly dial-up connection to the internet. Why do
			I mention this? Well because it is not going to be as easy to keep this web
			site updated. I will do my best, but it likely will not be as frequently changing
			as it was in the past. Just bear with us and new photos will come.</p>
		<p>
			Below are some photos of our new place. Want to see more? Then you'll have to come
			visit us and see it in person. We have lots of room now, inside and out.</p>
		<p>
			And here is what you've been waiting for. The latest photos of Sabine. She has really
			changed over the last 6 or 8 weeks. She has become much more independent, we now
			find ourselves spending a lot of our time keeping her from getting into things.
			She is opening all of our cabinets and drawers and pulling everything out. We have
			baby locks on order!</p>
		<p>
			Sabine received a new wagon for her birthday from her Gramma &amp; Grampa Groth.
			With the move and all we decided not to assemble it until just this week. Below
			are some photos of a special little girl in her shiny new wagon.</p>
		<p>
			William John Krause had his 3rd birthday recently (actually back in July). Judy
			took the photos below and we scanned them in (and shrunk and compressed the heck
			out of them). As you can see, Sabine had a great time at Wills party. He throws
			a good party for a 3yr old. A few are Gramma Groth trying to get a photo
			like one she has of Nancy around this age.</p>
		<p>
			Sabine is just so much fun these days. She is always full of spunk and ready to
			play, but can also entertain herself at times. The best of all worlds. She is not
			walking yet but we expect she might get around to that pretty soon. She gets a lot
			of practice leaning up against things, now sometimes with just one hand. She is
			so fast on her hands and knees it's no wonder she has no need to walk yet.</p>
		<p>
			Late August brought Sabines first trip to the ocean. She really seemed to like everything
			about the beach. The sand was fun, the waves were fun. She didn't even mind the
			wind. Our little family had a really nice time. After the beach we had ice cream,
			maybe not such a good idea to feed the girl ice cream before a long ride home. She
			was a tad cranky the whole way home.</p>
