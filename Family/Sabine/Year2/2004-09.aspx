		<h3>Sabine - September 2004</h3>
		<p>
			Ok, we haven't been doing very well at updating this site lately. Things have been
			busy, but it is also hard to come up with photos that have any significance or show
			something new. It's also a lot of work of course. So here is the latest installment.</p>
		<p>
			Sabine had her 15 month checkup at the beginning of the month. She is doing just
			dandy, almost 30" tall, but still down in the 22lb neighborhood. She is now
			growing up instead of out. She had more vaccinations at this checkup. This time
			she seemed to have come down with a very mild cases of measles as a side effect.
			Apparently that is normal is some percentage of kids. She really just had a mild
			fever and a rash for a few days. It didn't seem to bother her very much. She also
			has at least one new tooth and we think another is close to erupting. She seems
			to have some cranky spells that we attribute to teething. Nothing like her first
			few teeth but noticeable.</p>
		<p>
			She has really learned to use her tricycle/walker quite well. She can now maneuver
			it around corners with ease and pretty much get anywhere she wants upstairs. She
			seems to go in cycles where she likes to play with it, then days or weeks when she
			ignores it. She still periodically experiments with standing with no support but
			isn't yet walking. We're convinced she could walk if she really wanted to, but she
			seems to be happy either crawling or walking along furniture for support.</p>
		<p>
			She is saying a number of words now. Some that are just words that she can say but
			doesn't understand the meaning, others she really seems to get. Every time we walk
			downstairs past where we hang our hats she loves to say 'hats'. She has the cutest
			little voice and this word really seems to bring out the cuteness. We're not sure
			why she likes that word so much, perhaps from the 'is it a hat' game Nancy plays
			with her sometimes, as she puts things on Sabine's head.</p>
		<p>
			She has been waking up in the middle of the night now and again with what we think
			are night terrors. Basically where she wakes from a bad dream and can't get out
			of it. She is in a really frenzied state and it sometimes takes 20 or 30 minutes
			for her to shake it off and settle down. There appears to be nothing we can do to
			calm her during the whole thing. Not a fun experience for any of us.</p>

			This past weekend, Nancy, Sabine and I walked a 5k for the 'Race for
			the Cure'. A very big and well known breast cancer awareness and fund raising event.
			This year over 37 thousand people made it to the Portland event. The weather was
			not ideal but we had a good time and it was for a very good cause. The three of
			us walked with Grandma Robichaud in mind. Sabine insisted we support her any way
			we can.</p>
		<p>
			It was a long day for Sabine. We had to wake her up at 6am, something she isn't
			used to. Then she had to sit in her car seat and the stroller for long periods.
			She was a trooper though and didn't complain for a minute. She really likes to be
			around lots of people. Odd, since her parents don't really follow the same path.
			After the walk we all went to our favorite 'Sabine friendly' restaurant that we
			affectionately call the salad store. Sweet Tomatoes is a salad bar type of place,
			and it's great for Sabine as we can get her samples of all sorts of good veggies
			and fruits. She always has a good meal there. It also has significance for Nancy
			and I as we went there a number of times after her regular doctors visits while
			she was pregnant.</p>
		<p>
			Sabine had her first ice cream cone at the salad store. She has had ice cream before, but
			Sweet Tomatoes has tiny little cones, maybe 1/4 normal size. So Sabine was able
			to hold it herself and eat the ice cream and cone. It was cute, wish we had the
			camera!</p>

			Sabine is walking! Yep, that is the big news for this update. She started walking
			unassisted for the first time on Friday September 24th. Nancy and I were both on
			the floor with about 6 feet between us. We stood Sabine up and let go! She was pretty
			wobbly at first but was able to take 5 or 6 steps between us. Over the course of
			the following weekend she got in lots of practice and is progressing very rapidly.
			Now she can walk around our kitchen island when she wants. Its pretty amazing. We
			think she waited to walk until she was really ready to do it right!</p>
		<p>
			Below are some photos of her in action...</p>
