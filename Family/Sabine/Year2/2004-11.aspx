		<h3>Sabine - November 2004</h3>
		<p>
			<font color="#f3b600"><span style="color: #00ff00">11/08/04</span></font> - We now have a little shopper. Nancy bought
			Sabine a toy shopping cart last week as a pick-me-up after Sabine had some vaccinations.
			I wish I could have been there as Nancy said Sabine pushed the cart half way around
			the store while they shopped. I'm betting it was pretty cute. As you can see below
			she loves to push it around the house with various items inside, she then unloads
			the stuff where she deems it to belong.</p>
		<p>
			Sabine now knows the word 'up' very well. She can tell us when she wants to be picked
			up, and uses quite often. She is starting to understand 'down' as well. I think
			she knows 10 or so farm animal sounds, and probably a half dozen other words.</p>
		<p>
			Just this past weekend she amazed Nancy and I with her brilliance. We were coming
			inside from some play time outdoors and Nancy asked Sabine to take off her shoes.
			Well Sabine proceeded to sit down and undo the Velcro holding her shoes on. It was
			amazing to see her understand what we were asking and actually try it. She can't
			actually take the shoes off, but she gets the idea. She is so smart!</p>
		<p>
			A few weeks ago was grandma &amp; grandpa Groth's anniversary. They decided that
			all they wanted was to have us all together to get some family photos taken. Below
			is the result.</p>
		<p>
			<font color="#f3b600"><span style="color: #00ff00">11/22/04</span></font> - Sabine is really starting to get into everything
			lately. She has become quite a bit more agile, thus allowing her to explore places
			she couldn't get to before. Below you can see she recently discovered she can get
			into her laundry basket and it's quite fun. She also has learned that the toy we
			bought her to help learn to walk is also quite fun as a motorcycle. She figured
			out that her feet fit into the foot rests quite nicely giving her a comfortable
			seating position. I saw her do this and thought it would be fun to push her around.
			She loved it! I happened to say 'wee' a few times as I pushed her around, now she
			knows that if she says 'wee' in her cutest little voice that I'll come over and
			push her some more. She is now addicted, which might have been a problem if she
			was not quite so adorable.</p>
		<p>
			She is really starting to learn individual words that allow her to get something,
			even if she mispronounces them. 'Wee' is one example, but also 'bites' for food,
			'bup' for her cup when she's thirsty, 'up' for us to pick her up and 'down' to put
			her down. I'm sure there are a few others I'm forgetting. It is so great to be able
			to communicate with her, even on this primitive level.</p>
		<p>
			Have I mentioned what an incredibly sweet little girl she is? She just loves to
			give us hugs and kisses, on her terms of course. For a while now she will spontaneously
			walk up to Nancy or I, hug one of our legs and say 'ooooh'. It is so adorable. Often
			she will also kiss our leg at the same time and say 'mmmmmba'. It just melts our
			hearts.</p>
		<p>
			This past week her sleeping habits have changed some. Previously, any time she woke
			up she would cry if we were not beside her in bed. A few times in the last week
			she has instead gotten out of bed walked over to the bedroom door, opened it, and
			walked out into the hallway before crying for us. A whole new phase.</p>
		<p>
			Last night the little imp dropped her cup over the side of the bed while I was trying
			to get her to sleep. She quickly realized she is now able to get out of bed and
			go get it, so she did. But instead of getting back in bed she decided she would
			open the door and go play in the hall. I just sat there in bed and watched, realizing
			she now has a new sense of freedom in the ability to do and go where she wants.
			I quickly went out to the hall and brought her back in of course, but it is amazing
			how recently it was that she couldn't even get out of bed on her own. She is growing
			so fast...</p>
