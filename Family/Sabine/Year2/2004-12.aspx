		<h3>Sabine - December 2004</h3>
		<p>
			<font color="#f3b600"><span style="color: #00ff00">12/13/04</span></font> - This
			weekend we went hunting for our Christmas tree. We visited three of the
			many many tree farms nearby. The first was selling 'uncultured' trees as they called
			them. Basically trees that had not been trimmed and had grown past their usual harvest
			date, by more than a few years! People were allowed to cut the trees from any height,
			often 3 or more feet up from the base to get one the right size. Kind of an odd
			arrangement, but they were trying to get some value out of a tree farm they purchased
			last year from owners that had neglected the trees for the past 5 or 10 years. The
			trees were a great deal, under 7' for $10, over 7' for $20. We didn't find what
			we wanted.</p>
		<p>
			On to the next farm, Haggs. Here we discovered the prices were a bit steep at $45
			for a 6' tree. They had a neat atmosphere with a small live animal display and lots
			of crafts to purchase. Sabine had an opportunity to see a live sheep, she loves
			to say 'baaaa'. We visited the pumpkin patch at this same farm in October. A neat
			place but not for the tree we wanted. I think they really cater to the 'city' folks
			from Beaverton.</p>
		<p>
			Our final stop was at 'Mikes Tree Farm', just up the road from Haggs. He was selling
			any tree we wanted for $10. Oh what a deal. Most of his trees were on the short
			side, just what we were looking for. We found a great tree, very natural looking
			with just enough trimming during its life to give it the right basic shape. Perfect.
			Below you can see a few photos of the tree. We put it up high to keep the exploring
			fingers of a certain cute little girl from causing too much trouble.</p>
		<p>
			We think the tree was a little frustrating for her as she seemed in a cranky mood
			when around it. We think she really wanted to play with the ornaments but was frustrated
			she couldn't reach most of them. Hopefully next year we'll have a full size tree
			that she can enjoy even more.</p>
		<p>
			<font color="#f3b600"><span style="color: #00ff00">1/06/05</span></font> - Christmas
			has come and gone. We think Sabine had a really great time. Her auntie Nicole
			arrived early evening on the 20th of December. Sabine almost immediately took to
			her, like we've never seen. They had not seen each other in a year yet Sabine seemed
			to recognize her right away. We think she had Nicole confused with auntie Renee.
			We spent some leisurely time with Nicole for a few days, shopping and hanging out.</p>
		<p>
			Then on Wednesday evening (the 22nd) auntie Renee and uncle Tio arrived on a thickly
			fogged night. We all relaxed the next day waiting for mom to arrive late that
			evening. Sabine slept in a different room that night and didn't do very well.</p>
		<p>
			Moms flight was delayed by a few hours, so she and I didn't get back to the house until
			almost midnight on Thursday the 23rd. But from what we heard she was incredibly
			lucky. Many other folks traveling that day were stranded all across the country.</p>
		<p>
			The following day was Christmas eve at our house. John and Judy came up for a few
			hours to celebrate with the Robichaud's. Good food and much fun was had. On Christmas
			day we all got up early for various reasons. Nancy, Sabine and I because Sabine
			once again did not sleep well. Mom and Nicole because they were still on East coast
			time, and Renee &amp; Tio? Who knows, maybe all the noise the rest of us made. We
			were up around 6am. You can see in the photos below that Sabine had a huge assortment
			of presents waiting for her. We lounged around, drank coffee, ate cheese braids
			and opened presents.</p>
		<p>
			Then mid day we headed down to John and Judys in Keizer. We had a great time there
			with Jerry, Grampa Lien and Deb. Judy made a fantastic chicken cordon bleu.</p>
		<p>
			Auntie Nicole, Renee and uncle Tio all had to leave the day after Christmas. That
			left Sabine to play with her grandma Robichaud for a few more days. She had a great
			time with gramma, while mommy and daddy caught up on a few projects. We went to
			see the Oregon ZooLights Monday evening. It was cold but fun. Oh and we hit the
			childrens museum just before that. Sabine really seemed to like it. Gramma left
			early on Wednesday the 29th.</p>
