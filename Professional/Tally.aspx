		<h3>My Tally Career</h3>
		<p>
			I was a founder (and remained so until Novell purchased Tally in 2005) and until
			my move to Oregon in 2000 a Software Team Lead at <a target="_new" href="http://www.tallysystems.com">
			Tally Systems Corp</a>, a software development company in Lebanon <a target="_new" href="http://www.nh.com">
			New Hampshire</a>. As one of the company's
			ten founding members I was with Tally since its very humble beginning back in
			May of 1990. I came to Tally directly out of college and was incredibly fortunate
			to become involved with such a great group of people. I really found the best of
			all worlds. A brand new high-tech company, out in the middle of the spectacular
			surroundings of northern New England, and ownership of a company along with nine
			of the best people I've ever known professionally. What else could I ask for? It's
			been an amazing ride to watch Tally grow from the tiny little software company of
			11 employees when I started to a midsize company of over 230 people at its height.</p>
		<p>
			As a software developer I worked in the Engineering group at Tally. I developed
			mostly in C/C++ using Microsoft <a target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/">Visual C++</a> and
			the Microsoft Foundation Classes. Since Tally was into asset management tools we
			did a lot of client/server development. The mainstay database systems we supported
			were Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle as well as MSDE on the desktop. The majority of my 
			development at Tally was on the Windows 9x and Windows 2000/XP platforms.
			I've been developing software with MFC dating back to Beta1 of Windows 95, sometime
			in late 1993 or early 1994 as I recall. I've been into client/server development
			since about 1997.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The last project I worked on at Tally was a complete rewrite of its flagship product,
			<b>TS.Census</b>. We turned it into a full
			Win32 enterprise level client/server application. It's an amazingly complex undertaking
			and turned out to be a highly challenging project. I managed 5 other developers
			working on the GUI side of the application, as well as did some significant development
			myself. Two of these 5 developers worked in Albuquerque NM, making the job even
			more challenging. We also had teams working on the field applications, the backend
			database, middleware application objects and server applications. In all more than
			20 engineers were involved in the project.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Before that I worked on a new application for Tally called <b>Veranda Enterprise
				Messaging Reporter</b>. Veranda was a ground breaking product designed
				to manage all of a companies messaging systems. Veranda tracked, analyzed and reported
				on the myriad of electronic communications activities happening at every level of
				an organization. I worked mostly on the GUI and database aspects of Veranda and
				I'm pretty proud of how it turned out. Veranda was more than 18 months in the making,
				and Version 1.0 was released in June of 1997.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>I've worked on a number of other projects for Tally in the past. Most of
				my time has been spent on previous versions of <b>NetCensus</b> (now
				known as TS.Census). I designed and implemented the <b>Win32 Collector</b>
				back in 1994. This nifty application will scan your
				Windows based machine and detail for you a complete list of all currently installed
				hardware and software. It has a very modern GUI front end and Tally Systems patented
				software recognition algorithm on the backend. This was my first foray into the
				world of Win32 and MFC.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>The software recognition algorithm was one of the earliest projects I worked on
				for Tally. Myself and 3 other developers were granted a patent for its innovative
				technology in 1995. <a target="_new" href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?u=%2Fnetahtml%2Fsrchnum.htm&Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&r=1&l=50&f=G&d=PALL&s1=5440738.PN.&OS=PN/5440738&RS=PN/5440738">
				Patent #5440738</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Back in the startup days of Tally I was the also Network Administrator
				for our <a target="_new" href="http://www.novell.com">Novell Netware</a> based LAN. I ran the network, the telecommunication
				systems and managed user workstations all while working on day to day development
				of NetCensus (at the time our only product). The Network admin stuff was a lot of
				fun (and some not so fun) but Tally had grown considerably, so back in 1994
				I passed the network management on to a full time systems administrator. At its
				peak Tally Systems had an IT department of 10 employees. My, my, times do change...
